# EMAIL DRAFTING ASSISTANT | CrewAI + LangGraph

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration of CrewAI with LangChain and LangGraph to automate email checking and drafting. CrewAI orchestrates autonomous AI agents that collaborate and perform tasks efficiently, allowing you to automatically draft emails based on incoming messages.


## CrewAI Framework
CrewAI enables AI agents to work together in a collaborative and efficient manner. In this project, CrewAI agents are orchestrated to automate email checking and drafting, making communication management easier and faster.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Nithish-Chowdary/Email_Drafting_CrewAI-Langgraph.git
   cd Email_Drafting_CrewAI-LangGraph
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
